As a non-commissioned officer in the Air Force and now Space Force for the past two decades, I have developed a deep expertise in technology and a passion for helping teams succeed. In June 2023, I will be retiring from the military and transitioning to the tech industry, with a focus on DevOps architecture and Data Science.

I have a strong background in web design, software development, and data visualization, and I am eager to apply these skills to the challenges of the tech industry. My goal is to become a skilled storyteller through Data Science and Analytics, while also leveraging my experience in DevOps architecture to bridge the gap between technology and business solutions.

As a DevOps architect, I can help organizations implement best practices for software development, deployment, and maintenance, ensuring that technology solutions are aligned with business objectives. With my technical expertise and experience leading teams, I am confident that I can help organizations achieve their goals and drive innovation through technology.

Whether it's working on DevOps projects, leveraging data to drive business decisions, or collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver successful outcomes, I am excited to apply my skills to new challenges and help organizations thrive in the digital age.
