For the past two decades, I have been a non-commissioned officer in the Air Force and now Space Force. I will transition to the tech industry upon retirement in June of 2023.

I enjoy everything digital, including web design, software development, and data visualization.

My focus today is to develop my skillsets as a Storyteller through Data Science and Analytics. With my experience and technical prowess, helping teams succeed is my passion!
