For the past two decades, I've served as a non-commissioned officer in the Air Force and now Space Force, developing a deep expertise in technology and a passion for helping teams succeed. In June 2023, I'll be retiring from the military and transitioning to the tech industry, with a focus on DevOps.

With a strong background in web design, software development, and data visualization, I bring a unique set of skills to the table, including the ability to effectively communicate technical concepts and solutions to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

As a DevOps engineer, effective communication is key. By bridging the gap between technology and business solutions, I can align technology solutions with business objectives and drive innovation. This approach fosters collaboration and cross-functional success by building empathy and understanding across teams.

In addition, conveying the importance of DevOps and its impact on the organization is critical. By articulating the value of DevOps in a way that resonates with stakeholders, I can build buy-in and support for initiatives, leading to more successful outcomes.

Overall, my background in technology and my communication skills position me to excel as a DevOps engineer. I look forward to leveraging my expertise to drive innovation and foster success by building effective relationships across teams.
