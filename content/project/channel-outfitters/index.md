## Project Overview

Channel Outfitters is a website I designed and developed for Lindsey Channel's Montana Outfitter Guide business. The primary goals of the project were to create a mobile-friendly website that is responsive to different screen sizes and to make it easy for Lindsey to post blog updates about his services.

## Project Details

I took a minimalist approach to the design of the website, focusing on making it easy to navigate and providing visitors with essential information about Lindsey's guide services. The website includes a contact form that visitors can use to get in touch with Lindsey and book his services.

One of the key features of the website is its mobile-friendly design, which ensures that visitors can access the site from any device and get a consistent user experience. The site is built using Hugo, a fast and flexible static site generator that allows for easy content updates and site maintenance.
