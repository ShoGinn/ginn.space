I took a minimal approach to this project. The key elements were to enable visitors to view the website in a mobile-friendly format and make the website responsive to the screen size.

With that in mind, Lindsey was pleased with how he could easily do blog posts.

The most significant part of this is the ability to contact Lindsey about his services and see what his guide services are.
